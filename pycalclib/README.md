# `pycalclib`

This is the Python layer for [calclib](https://github.com/brmmm3/calc-rs/tree/master/calclib). This package is for creating Python wheels.  
For simplicity `build_wheels.py` can be used to build the wheels. The Python script uses `pyenv` to choose different Python versions and `maturin` to buld the wheels.  
If you run the script with option it will build the Python module for the current used Python interpreter.  
When using the `--versions` option you can provide:

- a comma separated list of Python versions
- `*` to build Python modules for all versions installed by `pyenv`. Put it in quotation marks to avoid unexpected behavior.

**Note:**
As of now [manylinux](https://github.com/pypa/manylinux) wheels are failing to build with `cibuildwheel`, because the spec for libc 2.34 is still not released.
