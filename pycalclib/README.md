# `pycalclib`

This is the Python layer for [calclib](https://github.com/brmmm3/calc-rs/tree/master/calclib). This package is for creating Python wheels.  
For simplicity `build_wheels.py` can be used to build the wheels. The Python script uses `pyenv` to choose different Python versions and `maturin` to buld the wheels.
