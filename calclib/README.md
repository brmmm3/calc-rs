# `calclib`

This is the pure Rust library without any `pyo3` or `jni` dependencies.  
This package contains all the logic and is intended to be used in other Rust projects.

## Benchmarks

The example `calc.rs` in `benches` shows how to implement benchmarking with [criterion](https://docs.rs/criterion/latest/criterion).
